- Requires transparency obligations under Art. 52
- Does not fall under prohibited practices (Art. 5)
- Does not qualify as high-risk (Annex III)

## 2. Prohibited Practices Assessment (Art. 5)

### 2.1 Subliminal Techniques (Art. 5(1)(a))
**Status:** ‚úÖ Compliant
- No subliminal techniques employed
- All AI interactions are explicit and transparent

### 2.2 Exploitation of Vulnerabilities (Art. 5(1)(b))
**Status:** ‚úÖ Compliant
- No targeting of vulnerable groups
- Educational and professional development purpose only

### 2.3 Social Scoring (Art. 5(1)(c))
**Status:** ‚úÖ Compliant
- No social scoring mechanisms implemented
- No behavioral evaluation for social control

### 2.4 Real-time Biometric Identification (Art. 5(1)(d))
**Status:** ‚úÖ Compliant
- No biometric identification systems
- No real-time identification capabilities

## 3. High-Risk AI System Assessment (Art. 6 & Annex III)

### 3.1 Annex III Categories Review

**Safety Components (Annex III, 1):** ‚ùå Not applicable
**Infrastructure Management (Annex III, 2):** ‚ùå Not applicable
**Education and Training (Annex III, 3):** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial relevance
**Employment (Annex III, 4):** ‚ùå Not applicable

**Law Enforcement (Annex III, 6):** ‚ùå Not applicable
**Migration and Border (Annex III, 7):** ‚ùå Not applicable
**Administration of Justice (Annex III, 8):** ‚ùå Not applicable

### 3.2 Education and Training Analysis

**Assessment:** While AUTARK provides educational content, it:
- Does not determine access to educational institutions
- Does not assign students to institutions
- Does not evaluate student performance for official purposes
- Provides supplementary development tools only

**Conclusion:** Does not meet high-risk criteria
